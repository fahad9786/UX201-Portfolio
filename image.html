                    <h3>Summary:</h3>
                    <p>The Overhead Watering System project was initiated to address the needs of individuals who face difficulties in maintaining indoor plants due to physical disabilities or frequent absences from home. The system automates the watering process, employing sensors to administer water precisely when plants need it. Designed with sustainability in mind, it uses environmentally friendly materials and aims to conserve water by avoiding over-watering, making plant care effortless and more efficient.</p>

                <div class="detail-box">
                    <h3>Design Process:</h3>
                    <p>The development process began with targeted user research to gather insights into the specific needs of our audience. This was followed by iterative design sprints that involved rapid prototyping using recycled materials. Each prototype phase included user testing sessions, which provided critical feedback used to refine the system, focusing on usability, efficiency, and the precision of the watering mechanisms.</p>

                    <h3>Summary:</h3>
                    <p>This project introduced a compact, odorless compost bin tailored for urban residents, making composting an easy and accessible component of urban life. The bin's design is both user-friendly and environmentally conscious, encouraging sustainable waste management in tight spaces.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="detail-box">
                    <h3>Design Problem:</h3>
                    <p>We addressed the challenge of adapting composting solutions for urban environments, where space constraints and lifestyle pace often hinder traditional composting methods. Our solution needed to be efficient, aesthetically pleasing, and capable of fitting within small apartments without any foul odors.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="detail-box">
                    <h3>Design Process:</h3>
                    <p>Our approach was rooted in extensive market research to define the constraints and expectations of potential users. We then engaged in multiple prototyping rounds, each followed by rigorous testing to evaluate functionality and user satisfaction. Material choices were carefully considered to balance durability with environmental impact, ensuring the system remained sustainable and effective.</p>
